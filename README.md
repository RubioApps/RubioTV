# RubioTV

Web application written for PHP8.x that browses the collections of IPTV sources available at [iptv-org](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv)
With this app, you could to point to the exact channel you want to watch and add it to your favorites.

This works by a combination of the [iptv-org](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv) catalogue and the DTV sources streamed by a [TVHeadend]( https://github.com/tvheadend) service (add-on of any android box that runs Kodi, LibreElec or CoreElec)

In addition to the catalogue served by [iptv-org](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv) , it allows to upload your own sources .m3u / .m3u8.
In any case, you can request the EPG guide ad-hoc for a given channel. To do so, you would need to install the NodeJS app from [EPG](https://github.com/iptv-org/epg)
Otherwise, you have to disable this option in the configuration file.

This web apps uses a default template based on [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com) and [JQuery](https://jquery.com/), which is fully responsive for mobile devices.
It is recommended to run this web app under Apache2 for domestic purposes

## Build your folders

The most efficient and secured structure to run this web app is

```
yoursite.com 
└───iptv-org-epg
└───tmp
└───log
└───public
    │   configuration.php
    │   cron.php
    │   index.php
    │   README.md
    |   ...
    └───cache
    └───guides
    └───includes
    └───iptv
    └───local
    └───models
    └───sef
    └───static
    └───templates
```
### /iptv-org-epg 

It the NodeJS application installed from [EPG](https://github.com/iptv-org/epg).
If this is not installed, the guide service will not worlk for IPTV sources, and this option has to be disabled in the configuration file.

### /tmp

This is used for temporary uploads.

### /log

This is used to collect the logs generated by PHP.

### /public
This folder contains the web application RubioTV.
Download RubioTV and unzip it into the public folder.

## Apache2 setup

You can create a directory in your main Apache web application that points to */yoursite.com/public* folder.
The other subfolders are used only for functional purposes, but they are not accessibles by the clients. 
Therefore, their access is forbidden.

Please notice that the **CORS protection** might be setup and the DTV might not work.
In order to find a workaround, you have to setup a reverse proxy.

The whole Apache2 setup (mysite.conf) would be like this
```
    Alias "/tv" "/path/to/your/site/public"
    <Directory "/path/to/your/site/public">  
      DirectoryIndex index.php index.html
      Options FollowSymLinks
      AllowOverride All
      Require all granted            
      <IfModule "mod_headers.c">        
        Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
        Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE, PUT"
        Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "x-requested-with, Content-Type, origin, authorization, accept, client-security-token"
        Header always set Access-Control-Expose-Headers "Content-Security-Policy, Location"
        Header always set Access-Control-Max-Age "600"        
      </IfModule>        
      <FilesMatch "\.php$">
        SetHandler "proxy:unix:/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost/"
      </FilesMatch>        
    </Directory>
    <Directory "/path/to/your/site/epg"> 
      Order deny,allow
      Deny from all
    </Directory>
    <Directory "/path/to/your/site/log"> 
      Order deny,allow
      Deny from all
    </Directory>
    <Directory "/path/to/your/site/tmp"> 
      Order deny,allow
      Deny from all
    </Directory>
    <IfModule "mod_proxy.c">   
      ProxyPass /coreelec/ http://coreelec.home:9981/
      ProxyPassReverse /coreelec/ http://coreelec.home:9981/      
    </IfModule>  
```
## Configuration

RubioTV can be fully configured by overriding the file [configuration.php](https://github.com/RubioApps/RubioTV/blob/main/configuration.php).
Please notice that, in addition to the basic features, you can enable two additional services:

__DTV__: you would need an accessible service in your LAN. The default configuration points to a, android box that runs a TVHeadend instance
__EPG__: you would need to installed from iptv-org. Please follow the instruction on that page.

You can disable both services if you want a basic IPTV browser.

If you have decided to install the NodeJS application EPG from IPTV-org, **you have to setup your PHP to be able to execute shell commands**.
To do so, you have add the Apache user (usually www-data) to the sudoers

```
sudo nano /etc/sudoers
```
Add the line (replace the /var/www/mysite.com/ by the exising path at your server)
```
www-data ALL=NOPASSWD: /var/www/mysite.com/public/guides/.unlock
```
As soon as the sudoers file is save, Apache2 / PHP will be able to execute the unique file named .unlock.
This file is used as an anti-flood mechanism to avoid to over-charge the server with the NodeJS requests to obtain the guides.

## Cron
When the EPG service is active, you might decide to setup a cron job to execute a period request of the guides.
If you decided to do so, you hav to edit the crontab for the Apache user (usually www-dataà
```
sudo crontab -e -u www-data
```

Add the line
```
0/15 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/your/site/public/cron.php #RubioTV EPG Process
```
We recommend to execute the cronjob every 15 minutes for local purposes. You can make it mre frequently depending on the available ressources in your server.
